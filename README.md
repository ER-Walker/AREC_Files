# AREC_Files
Welcome to the AREC_Files Repository!

The Amateur Robotics and Electronics Coalition at UPJ have decided to put all the code files you may need into one collaborative place.

Some quick tips:

1. The main branch is for current projects that the club is working on.

2. Branches will be divided into semesters as to try and keep code more contained. These should also include previous project files

3. Have fun :)


If you need to be added to the repository, please contact an officer through our page on Experience Pitt.
