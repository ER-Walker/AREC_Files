# AREC_Files
Welcome to the AREC_Files Repository!

The Amateur Robotics and Electronics Coalition at UPJ have decided to put all the code files you may need into one collaborative place.

Some quick tips:
    1. The main branch is simply for general code that may be used throughout different semesters and the the README
    2. Branches will be divided into semesters as to try and keep code more contained
    3. Have fun :)
    

If you need to be added to the repository, please contact an officer through our page on Experience Pitt.
